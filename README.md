Portfolio project to maintain a log for all transactions and assess individual asset
The idea is to create an application to 
    1. log all crypto-currency transactions.
    2. analyse profit and loss based on various criteria like Currency, current market rate, overall position etc.
    3. create a wallet for each crypto being analysed so that a trade can be triggered from the application itself
